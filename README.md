### Task 2a: MVP

#### Create selectors to point your data into elements

* [ ] Create selectors by using any of the DOM element's methods
* [ ] Note that IDs have been used on all images. Use the IDs to update src path content

#### Update the HTML with the JSON data

* [ ] Remember, NO direct updating of the HTML source is allowed.
* [ ] Using your selectors, update the content to match the example file.
* [ ] Remember to update the src attributes on images

#### Add new content

* [ ] Change the color of the navigation text to be green.
* [ ] Utilize `.appendChild()` and `.prepend()` to add two new items to the navigation system. You can call them whatever you want.
* [ ] Check your work by looking at the [original html](original.html) in the browser

### Task 3: Stretch

* [ ] Update styles throughout the page as you see fit. Study what happens when you updated the DOM using style in JavaScript.  
* [ ] Study tomorrow's lesson on events and try to integrate a button that can update content on the site with a click of a button.  You could build a similar data object with new values to help you test the click event.

#### Stretch Project: Digital Timer

This project is heavier on logic but employs some DOM manipulation to achieve its goals.  Go check it out here: [stretch assignment](stretch-assignment) and see how far you can get.
